# Asynchronous Server Technologies - Final project

AST Final project [Explain what it is...]

## Installation instructions

Clone the project from [github](https://github.com/Riemannn/AST_Final_Project).  
In a terminal, run `npm install` from the project's root.  
Before starting, you **must** duplicate the `.env.example.coffee` file and name it `.env.coffee`.  
It is recommended to take a look inside the file to see the set environment variables.  
If you wish to change the server's hosting IP address or port, you can do so in the `.env.coffee` file.

## Run

In a terminal, run `npm start` from the the project's root.  
Now go on your favorite web browser, and browse to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) or any other address you chose in the `.env.coffee` file.

## Tests

In a terminal, run `npm test` from the the project's root.  
Aaand that's all there is to do ! Really easy, right ?
